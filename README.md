# Certificates
Here you can find all the certificates I earned. While I learn for the skill, not the certificate, I still want to gather them here to show my effort and prove my determination. <br>
I'm constantly working on improving my skills, especially in the fields of SQL and Power BI / DAX. I am currently working as a Senior Data Management Assistant for over 7 years and regularly trying to use new skills in my day-to-day tasks of data management. <br>
<br>
My current goal is to prepare and pass these courses-
1. Google Data Analytics
2. Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (PL-300)
3. IBM Data Analytics
4. Google Advanced Data Analytics
